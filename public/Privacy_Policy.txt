Privacy Policy

Last Updated: November 28, 2025

Chad Mint Finance ("we," "us," or "our") operates the website https://chadmint.fun (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclosure, and safeguard your information when you visit our Site and use our services, including our token launchpad, swap aggregator, and AI support chat.

By using our Site, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.

1. The Nature of Blockchain Technology

Please be aware that Chad Mint is a Web3 application built on the Solana blockchain. Transactions on the blockchain are public, immutable, and permanent.

When you use our services to mint tokens, create pools, or swap assets:

Your wallet address (Public Key) is permanently recorded on the Solana blockchain.

Transaction details (amounts, token metadata, timestamps) are publicly visible to anyone.

We cannot delete, modify, or hide information once it has been committed to the blockchain.

2. Information We Collect

We collect information in the following ways:

A. Information You Provide Directly

Wallet Information: We collect your public wallet address when you connect your wallet to the Site. We do not have access to your private keys or seed phrases.

User Content: If you create a token, we collect the images and metadata (name, symbol, description, social links) you upload. This content is uploaded to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) via Pinata and becomes publicly accessible.

Chat Communications: When you use our AI support bot, the content of your messages is collected to provide responses.

B. Information Collected Automatically

Usage Data: We use Vercel Analytics to collect anonymous data about how the Site is accessed and used (e.g., pages visited, session duration).

Device & Log Data: Our servers automatically record information such as your IP address, browser type, and operating system.

Specific Note on IP Addresses: We use your IP address for security purposes, specifically to implement rate limiting on our API endpoints (such as the AI chat and token discovery) to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.

3. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

To Provide Services: facilitating token minting, IPFS uploads, and blockchain interactions.

To Improve the Site: analyzing usage trends via Vercel Analytics to optimize user experience.

Security & Fraud Prevention: using wallet signatures to verify ownership before allowing file uploads and using IP addresses to rate-limit requests via Upstash Redis.

Customer Support: processing your queries through our AI chatbot.

4. Third-Party Services

We utilize third-party services to operate Chad Mint. These providers may have access to your information to perform specific tasks on our behalf. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies.

Solana Blockchain: Public ledger where transactions are recorded.

Pinata: Used for storage of token images and metadata on IPFS.

Helius: Used as an RPC provider to communicate with the Solana network.

OpenRouter: Used to process queries sent to our AI support bot.

Vercel: Hosts our website and provides analytics.

Upstash: Provides Redis database services for caching and rate limiting.

Meteora & Jupiter: We integrate with their protocols for bonding curves and swaps.

5. Cookies and Local Storage

We use local storage and cookies to improve your experience:

Local Storage: We store cached data (such as "Hot Tokens" or metadata) in your browser's local storage to speed up loading times and reduce API requests.

Wallet Adapters: Third-party wallet providers may use cookies or local storage to maintain your connection session.

6. Data Retention

Blockchain Data: Data stored on the Solana blockchain is permanent and cannot be deleted.

IPFS Data: Content uploaded to IPFS is distributed and effectively permanent; we cannot ensure its deletion from the network.

Server Logs: We retain server logs and IP address records only for as long as necessary for security and debugging purposes.

7. Security of Your Information

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information.

We use HTTPS/TLS encryption for all web traffic.

No Custody: We do not have custody of your funds. All transactions are signed by you via your non-custodial wallet.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

8. Children's Privacy

Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.

9. Governing Law

This Privacy Policy is governed by the federal laws of Canada, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
